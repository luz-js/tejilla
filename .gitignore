# Ignored existing files/folders from initial project scan that are being replaced or not used:
# These are based on the initial `ls` output and might need adjustment.
# If you are replacing the functionality of these folders/files with the new backend,
# you might want to remove them from the project entirely rather than just ignoring them.
